# Reference Image Drop Folder

This folder is reserved for ministry and event photos that need to be referenced on the website.

## How to use

1. Collect 5â€“6 high-quality images that represent the current season of ministry.
2. Rename the files to match the slots used on the website:
   - `pastor-01.jpg`
   - `pastor-02.jpg`
   - `pastor-03.jpg`
   - `pastor-04.jpg`
   - `pastor-05.jpg`
   - `pastor-06.jpg`
3. Place the images in this folder. JPEG or PNG files under 2 MB work best.
4. Refresh the website preview in your browser. The gallery on the home page will display any images that were added.

> Tip: If you need to remove an image temporarily, either delete it from this folder or rename it so it no longer matches one of the slots above.
