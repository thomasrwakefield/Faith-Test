# Church Website Template

This project provides a simple set of HTML pages styled with TailwindCSS. Replace the placeholder images listed below with your own assets.

## Image Placeholders

| File Name | Recommended Size | Used In |
|-----------|-----------------|---------|
| `hero-image.jpg` | 1920x800 | Home page hero section |
| `mission-icon.png` | 200x200 | Home page Mission card |
| `service-icon.png` | 200x200 | Home page Service Times card |
| `visit-icon.png` | 200x200 | Home page Visit Us card |
| `pastor-photo.jpg` | 600x600 | Home page Pastor Intro and About page Leadership |
| `mission-hero.jpg` | 1200x400 | Mission page hero |
| `beliefs-hero.jpg` | 1200x400 | Beliefs page hero |
| `about-hero.jpg` | 1200x400 | About page hero |
| `elder1.jpg` | 400x400 | About page Leadership |
| `elder2.jpg` | 400x400 | About page Leadership |
| `church-history.jpg` | 800x600 | About page History section |
| `visit-hero.jpg` | 1200x400 | Visit page hero |
| `map-placeholder.jpg` | 800x600 | Visit page Location/map |
| `office-photo.jpg` | 800x600 | Contact page information section |

All images are stored in the `images/` directory (create it if it doesn’t exist). Replace these placeholders with actual images using the same filenames and suggested dimensions for best results.

## Reference Photo Library

To keep website refreshes fast, a dedicated drop folder has been added at `assets/reference-images/`. Any JPEG or PNG files that follow the names below will automatically appear in the "Reference Photo Library" section on the home page:

- `pastor-01.jpg`
- `pastor-02.jpg`
- `pastor-03.jpg`
- `pastor-04.jpg`
- `pastor-05.jpg`
- `pastor-06.jpg`

Steps to update the gallery:

1. Gather the 5–6 photos you would like to showcase (1600 × 1200px images under 2&nbsp;MB are ideal).
2. Rename each file to match the list above.
3. Copy the files into `assets/reference-images/`.
4. Refresh the site in your browser to confirm the images display without the placeholder cards.

If a slot does not have a matching image, a helpful placeholder will remain in place so you always know which filename to add next.
